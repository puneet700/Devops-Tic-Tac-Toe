# Project-2-AWS-TicTacToe-Game

**Tic-Tac-Toe Game Using AWS Services**

## 1. Project Overview

This project represents a simple yet interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game designed to familiarize users with various AWS services. It serves as an educational tool for those interested in cloud-based application deployment.

### Purpose
- To facilitate learning and demonstration of AWS services.
- To showcase the deployment of a cloud-based application.

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, JavaScript
- **Backend:** AWS Lambda (Python)
- **Hosting:** Amazon S3
- **API Management:** API Gateway

## 2. Features

- **Interactive Tic-Tac-Toe Game:** User-friendly interface to play against another player.
- **Game Logic:** Efficiently determines winners and handles draws.
- **Backend Integration:** The game logic is managed by AWS Lambda.
- **Hosting:** The game is publicly accessible through Amazon S3.
- **API Communication:** Real-time interaction via API Gateway.

## 3. Prerequisites

- An **AWS account**.
- Basic understanding of **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and **AWS services**.
- Essential tools:
  - A code editor (e.g., VS Code).
  - A web browser.

## 4. Installation and Setup

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Frontend Setup:**
   - Develop `index.html` and `script.js` for the user interface.
   - Incorporate the game board and controls in `index.html`.
   - Implement game logic and API calls in `script.js`.

2. **Upload to S3:**
   - Create an S3 bucket for hosting the game.
   - Upload the frontend files (`index.html` and `script.js`) to the S3 bucket.
   - Configure the bucket policy to allow public access.

3. **Configuring IAM:**
   - Assign necessary roles and policies to the Lambda function for permissions.

4. **Lambda Function Creation:**
   - Write the game logic in Python and deploy it as a Lambda function.

5. **API Gateway Setup:**
   - Establish a REST API in API Gateway.
   - Integrate the API with the Lambda function and generate endpoints.

6. **Frontend Integration:**
   - Update `script.js` to interact with the API Gateway endpoints.
   - Ensure seamless communication between the frontend and backend.

## 5. AWS Services Used

- **Amazon S3:** Hosting for frontend files.
- **AWS Lambda:** Backend game logic processing.
- **API Gateway:** Facilitates frontend-backend communication.
- **Amazon IAM:** Manages permissions and roles.

## 6. Deployment Steps

1. **Create S3 Bucket:**
   - Upload `index.html` and `script.js`.
   - Set public access policies for the bucket.

2. **Deploy Lambda Function:**
   - Implement the Lambda function with the provided Python code.
   - Test the function using API Gateway.

3. **API Gateway Integration:**
   - Ensure the frontend connects with API Gateway.
   - Validate the functionality of API endpoints.

4. **Testing the Application:**
   - Use the S3 bucket's public URL to test the game.
   - Verify the overall functionality and user experience.

## 7. Testing the Application

- **Browser Testing:**
  - Access the public URL of your S3 bucket via a web browser.
  - Play the game to ensure it functions as intended.

- **Debugging Tips:**
  - Address any CORS errors.
  - Confirm the API Gateway configuration is correct.

## 8. Known Issues

- **No Persistent Storage:** Currently, the game state is not stored persistently. If the page is refreshed, the game state is lost.
- **Limited Scalability:** The setup is designed for learning purposes and may not handle a high volume of concurrent users efficiently.
- **CORS Configuration:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues can arise if the API Gateway is not properly configured.
- **Latency:** There might be some latency in API responses, especially if the Lambda function experiences cold starts.
- **Single Game Session:** The game only supports a single session at a time. Multiple users cannot play separate games simultaneously without additional configuration.
- **Security Considerations:** The current setup might not include all necessary security measures, such as input validation, which could lead to potential vulnerabilities.
- **Basic UI:** The user interface is minimal and might not provide the best user experience.

### Beginner Perspectives
- **Understanding CORS:** Beginners might face challenges with CORS errors. Ensure you thoroughly understand how to configure CORS in API Gateway.
- **Lambda Function Cold Starts:** If you're new to AWS Lambda, you might notice initial latency due to cold starts. Learn about how Lambda functions work and how to mitigate this issue.
- **Frontend-Backend Integration:** Integrating the frontend with the backend can be complex. Start with simple API calls to ensure your configuration works.
- **Security Best Practices:** As a beginner, focus on learning basic security practices, such as input validation and role-based access control.

## 9. Best for Beginners

This project is particularly suitable for beginners due to the following reasons:
- **Simple Setup:** The instructions are clear and easy to follow.
- **Hands-on Learning:** Provides practical experience with AWS services.
- **Incremental Complexity:** Start with basic setups and gradually move to more complex integrations.
- **Community Support:** There are plenty of resources and communities online to help if you get stuck.
- **Real-World Application:** Demonstrates how different AWS services integrate to build a functional app.

## 10. Future Enhancements

- **User Authentication:** Add login functionality.
- **Leaderboard:** Implement a system to track player scores.
- **UI Enhancements:** Improve the game’s visual appeal.
